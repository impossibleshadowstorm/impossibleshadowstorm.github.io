      My educational journey has been a transformative experience that{" "}

      Applications (MCA) from Chandigarh University, I delved deep into{" "}
      <Cover>software development</Cover> and <Cover>data management</Cover>.
      Prior to that, I earned my Bachelor of Computer Applications (BCA) from
      Dev Sanskriti Vishwavidyalaya, where I built a solid foundation in
      computer science. My early education in Physics, Chemistry, and
      Mathematics nurtured my analytical thinking and problem-solving abilities.
      Each step of my academic path has <Cover>fueled my passion</Cover> for
      technology, encouraging me to pursue innovative solutions that can make a
      meaningful impact. I am dedicated to <Cover>continuous learning</Cover>,
